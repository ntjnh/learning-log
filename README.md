# Learning Log

### 8 May 2025

**Today's Focus**: Databases databases databases

**What I did today:** Worked on my Devjobs ASP.NET project that will use MongoDB for the data. It'll help me keep the knowledge fresh since getting my certification. That was for the Node.js path but I'm working through the C# path now. I also started looking at PostgreSQL since I'll need to learn a relational database if I want be a rockstar dev.
