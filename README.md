**Today's Focus**: Databases databases databases

**What I did today:** Worked on my Devjobs ASP.NET project that will use MongoDB for the data. It'll help me keep the knowledge fresh since getting my certification. That was for the Node.js path but I'm working through the C# path now. I also started looking at PostgreSQL since I'll need to learn a relational database if I want be a rockstar dev.

**Today's Focus**: Databases again but also ASP.NET MVC routing ðŸ˜’

**What I did today:** I really tried my best to resist using extra tools but I really struggled to get my MongoDB database working without using Entity Framework Core as well. I know it speeds things up and helps make things easier but I like to at least understand how to do things manually before I start using tools that make things quicker or easier. Anyway, it works now. I'm now going to figure out how to containerise the app as suggested by my mentor. The restrictions imposed by our office network means that I can't connect to my database while I'm in the office ðŸ™ƒ ANYWAYS. I also reluctantly did my routing differently as well because again, the hard way wouldn't work so I used the easier way/followed the MS Learn tutorial for creating a Web API with MongoDB and made the necessary changes to make it work for a regular web app. It was vastly easier and I can see why it's the better way of doing things so...no regrets...not really! I did a little bit more of the PostgreSQL tutorial but not much. I'm actually slightly considering using it for this app if it means I'll be able to connect to it in the office lol
